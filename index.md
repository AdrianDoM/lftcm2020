# Lean for the curious mathematician

A workshop on maths and theorem provers — [13–17 July 2020]

## Description
This workshop is intended for mathematicians who develop in Lean or wish to learn Lean.
We will have introductory tutorials, presentations,
and break-out sessions for specific areas of interest as directed by the attendees.
There is no initial knowledge needed,
everyone is welcome whether you are a new Lean learner or Lean expert.

## Why Lean?
The Lean theorem prover is a young and disruptive theorem prover
developed by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft Research.
Over the past two years it has attracted the attention of mathematicians.
Notable highlights include the formalisation of the independence of the continuum hypothesis,
the cap-set problem, the definition of manifolds (with boundaries/corners/etc),
and the definition of schemes and perfectoid spaces.

## Organisation
Main organisation by: 
[Johan Commelin](https://math.commelin.net) and
[Patrick Massot](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~pmassot/en/).
