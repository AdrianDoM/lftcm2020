Let's show that taking polynomials over a ring is functor `Ring ‚•§ Ring`.

local attribute [irreducible] polynomial.eval‚ÇÇ

mathlib is undergoing a transition at the moment from using "unbundled" homomorphisms
(e.g. we talk about a bare function `f : R ‚Üí S`, along with a typeclass `[is_semiring_hom f]`)
to using "bundled" homomorphisms
(e.g. a structure `f : R ‚Üí+* S`, which has a coercion to a bare function).

The category `Ring` uses bundled homomorphisms (and in future all of mathlib will).
However at present the polynomial library hasn't been updated.

You may find the `ring_hom.of` useful -- this upgrades an unbundled homomorphism
to a bundled homomorphism.

Bonus problem:

Why did we set `local attribute [irreducible] polynomial.eval‚ÇÇ`?
What goes wrong without it? Why?
