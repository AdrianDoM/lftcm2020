/-! ### Local homeomorphisms

Local homeomorphisms are globally defined maps with a globally defined "inverse", but the only
relevant set is the *source*, which should be mapped homeomorphically to the *target*.
-/



/- Define a local homeomorphism from `‚Ñù` to `‚Ñù` which is just `x ‚Ü¶ -x`, but on `(-1, 1)`. In
Lean, the interval `(-1, 1)` is denoted by `Ioo (-1 : ‚Ñù) 1` (where `o` stands for _open_). -/

@[simp] lemma neg_mem_Ioo_minus_one_one (x : ‚Ñù) : -x ‚àà Ioo (-1 : ‚Ñù) 1 ‚Üî x ‚àà Ioo (-1 : ‚Ñù) 1 :=
begin
  sorry
end

def my_first_local_homeo : local_homeomorph ‚Ñù ‚Ñù :=
{ to_fun := Œª x, -x,
  inv_fun := Œª x, -x,
  source := Ioo (-1) 1,
  target := sorry,
  map_source' :=
  begin
    sorry
  end,
  map_target' :=
  begin
    sorry
  end,
  left_inv' :=
  begin
    sorry
  end,
  right_inv' :=
  begin
    sorry
  end,
  open_source := sorry,
  open_target := sorry,
  continuous_to_fun := sorry,
  continuous_inv_fun := sorry }

/- Two simple lemmas that will prove useful below. You can leave them sorried if you like. -/

lemma ne_3_of_mem_Ioo {x : ‚Ñù} (h : x ‚àà Ioo (-1 : ‚Ñù) 1) : x ‚â† 3 :=
begin
  sorry
end

lemma neg_ne_3_of_mem_Ioo {x : ‚Ñù} (h : x ‚àà Ioo (-1 : ‚Ñù) 1) : -x ‚â† 3 :=
begin
sorry
end

/- Now, define a second local homeomorphism which is almost like the previous one, -/

def my_second_local_homeo : local_homeomorph ‚Ñù ‚Ñù :=
{ to_fun := Œª x, if x = 3 then 0 else - x,
  inv_fun := Œª x, -x,
  source := Ioo (-1) 1,
  target := sorry,
  map_source' := sorry,
  map_target' := sorry,
  left_inv' := sorry,
  right_inv' := sorry,
  open_source := sorry,
  open_target := sorry,
  continuous_to_fun :=
  begin
    sorry
  end,
  continuous_inv_fun := sorry }

/- Although the two above local homeos are the same for all practical purposes as they coincide
where relevant, they are not *equal*: -/

lemma my_first_local_homeo_ne_my_second_local_homeo :
  my_first_local_homeo ‚â† my_second_local_homeo :=
begin
  sorry
end

/- The right equivalence relation for local homeos is not equality, but `eq_on_source`.
Indeed, the two local homeos we have defined above coincide from the point of view. -/

#check @local_homeomorph.eq_on_source

lemma eq_on_source_my_first_local_homeo_my_second_local_homeo :
  local_homeomorph.eq_on_source my_first_local_homeo my_second_local_homeo :=
begin
  sorry
end


/-! ### Charted space

A charted space is a topological space together with a set of local homeomorphisms to a model space,
whose sources cover the whole space. For instance, `‚Ñù` is already endowed with a charted space
structure with model space `‚Ñù`, where the unique chart is the identity:
-/

#check charted_space_self ‚Ñù

/- For educational purposes only, we will put another charted space structure on `‚Ñù` using the
local homeomorphisms we have constructed above. To avoid using too much structure of `‚Ñù` (and to
avoid confusing Lean), we will work with a copy of `‚Ñù`, on which we will only register the
topology. -/

@[derive topological_space]
def my‚Ñù : Type := ‚Ñù

instance : charted_space ‚Ñù my‚Ñù :=
{ atlas := { local_homeomorph.refl ‚Ñù, my_first_local_homeo },
  chart_at := Œª x, if x ‚àà Ioo (-1 : ‚Ñù) 1 then my_first_local_homeo else local_homeomorph.refl ‚Ñù,
  mem_chart_source :=
  begin
  sorry
  end,
  chart_mem_atlas :=
  begin
    sorry
  end }

/- Now come more interesting bits. We have endowed `my‚Ñù` with a charted space structure, with charts
taking values in `‚Ñù`. We want to say that this is smooth structure, i.e., the change of charts
are smooth. In Lean, this is written with `has_structure_groupoid`. A groupoid is a set of local
homeomorphisms of the model space (for example, local homeos that are smooth on their domain).
A charted space admits the groupoid as a structure groupoid if all the changes of coordinates
belong to the groupoid.

There is a difficulty that the definitions are set up to be able to also speak of smooth manifolds
with boundary or with corners, so the name of the smooth groupoid on `‚Ñù` has the slightly strange
name `times_cont_diff_groupoid ‚àû (model_with_corners_self ‚Ñù ‚Ñù)`. To avoid typing again and again
`model_with_corners_self ‚Ñù ‚Ñù`, let us introduce a shortcut
-/

abbreviation I := model_with_corners_self ‚Ñù ‚Ñù

/- In the library, there are such shortcuts for manifolds modelled on `‚Ñù^n`, denoted with `ùì° n`,
but for `n = 1` this does not coincide with the above one, as `‚Ñù^1` (a.k.a. `fin 1 ‚Üí ‚Ñù`) is not
the same as `‚Ñù`! -/

instance : has_groupoid my‚Ñù (times_cont_diff_groupoid ‚àû I) :=
begin
  -- in theory, we should prove that all compositions of charts are diffeos, i.e., they are smooth
  -- and their inverse are smooth. For symmetry reasons, it suffices to check one direction
  apply has_groupoid_of_pregroupoid,
  -- take two charts `e` and `e'`
  assume e e' he he',
  -- if next line is a little bit slow for your taste, you can replace `simp` with `squeeze_simp`
  -- and then follow the advice
  simp [atlas] at he he',
  dsimp,
  -- to continue, don't hesitate to use the fact that the restriction of a smooth function to a
  -- subset is still smooth there (`times_cont_diff.times_cont_diff_on`)
  sorry
end

/- The statement of the previous instance is not very readable. There is a shortcut notation: -/

instance : smooth_manifold_with_corners I my‚Ñù := {}

/- We will now study a very simple map from `my‚Ñù` to `‚Ñù`, the identity. -/

def my_map : my‚Ñù ‚Üí ‚Ñù := Œª x, x

/- The map `my_map` is a map going from the type `my‚Ñù` to the type `‚Ñù`. From the point of view of
the kernel of Lean, it is just the identity, but from the point of view of structures on `my‚Ñù`
and `‚Ñù` it might not be trivial, as we have registered different instances on these two types. -/

/- The continuity should be trivial, as the topologies on `my‚Ñù` and `‚Ñù` are definitionally the
same. So `continuous_id` might help. -/

lemma continuous_my_map : continuous my_map :=
sorry

/- Smoothness should not be obvious, though, as the manifold structures are not the same: the atlas
on `my‚Ñù` has two elements, while the atlas on `‚Ñù` has one single element.
Note that `my‚Ñù` is not a vector space, nor a normed space, so one can not ask whether `my_map`
is smooth in the usual sense (as a map between vector spaces): -/

-- lemma times_cont_diff_my_map : times_cont_diff ‚Ñù ‚àû my_map := sorry

/- does not make sense (try uncommenting it!) However, we can ask whether `my_map` is a smooth
map between manifolds, i.e., whether it is smooth when read in the charts. When we mention the
smoothness of a map, we should always specify explicitly the model with corners we are using,
because there might be several around (think of a complex manifold that you may want to consider
as a real manifold, to talk about functions which are real-smooth but not holomorphic) -/

lemma times_cont_mdiff_my_map : times_cont_mdiff I I ‚àû my_map :=
begin
  -- put things in a nicer form. The simpset `mfld_simps` registers many simplification rules for
  -- manifolds. `simp` is used heavily in manifold files to bring everything into manageable form.
  rw times_cont_mdiff_iff,
  simp only [continuous_my_map] with mfld_simps,
  -- simp has erased the chart in the target, as it knows that the only chart in the manifold `‚Ñù`
  -- is the identity.
  assume x y,
  sorry
end

/- Now, let's go to tangent bundles. We have a smooth manifold, so its tangent bundle should also
be a smooth manifold. -/

-- the type `tangent_bundle I my‚Ñù` makes sense
#check tangent_bundle I my‚Ñù

/- Construct the smooth manifold structure on the tangent bundle. Hint: the answer is a one-liner,
and this instance is not really needed. -/
instance tangent_bundle_my‚Ñù : smooth_manifold_with_corners (I.prod I) (tangent_bundle I my‚Ñù) :=
sorry

lemma times_cont_mdiff_tangent_map_my_map :
  times_cont_mdiff (I.prod I) (I.prod I) ‚àû (tangent_map I I my_map) :=
begin
  -- hopefully, there is a theorem saying that the tangent map to a smooth map is smooth.
  -- you can either try to guess its name, or hope that `suggest` will help you there.
  sorry
end

/- Can you show that this tangent bundle is homeomorphic to `‚Ñù √ó ‚Ñù`? You could try to build the
homeomorphism by hand, using `tangent_map I I my_map` in one direction and a similar map in the
other direction, but it is probably more efficient to use one of the charts of the tangent
bundle. (Harder question)

NB: the model space for the tangent bundle to a product manifold or a tangent space is not
`‚Ñù √ó ‚Ñù`, but a copy called `model_prod ‚Ñù ‚Ñù`. Otherwise, `‚Ñù √ó ‚Ñù` would have two charted space
structures with model `‚Ñù √ó ‚Ñù`, the identity one and the product one, which are not definitionally
equal. And this would be bad. But the topologies on `model_prod ‚Ñù ‚Ñù` and `‚Ñù √ó ‚Ñù` are the same,
so it is good enough to construct a homeomorphism with `model_prod ‚Ñù ‚Ñù`.
